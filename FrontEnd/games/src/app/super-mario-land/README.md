## Description

A remake of the famous and great Super Mario Land released in 1989 on the Game Boy.
I have used the original screen resolution of 160 x 144 Pixels.

The creation of this remake took more time than expected.
Only the first level was implemented, with the following components to follow:

- Enemy Nokobon
- Enemy Fly
- Platform at the end of the level is not working properly yet
- Currently you can go several times into the tubes
- Small details

This is a remake of the original game for educational purposes.
The rights remain with Nintendo.
